# TwilioSMSAPI
This project demonstrates how to build an SMS sending service using the Twilio API and the .NET 8 Web API framework. The primary goal is to create an API that allows users to
send SMS messages programmatically through Twilioâ€™s communication platform. By using .NET 8, this project leverages the latest features and enhancements in performance, security, 
and functionality.

## Key Components:
* Twilio API: Twilio is a cloud communications platform that enables developers to send and receive text messages, make phone calls, and more. It provides an easy-to-use
  API for sending SMS messages.
* .NET 8 Web API: The API is built using the .NET 8 Web API framework. This allows for a fast, efficient, and scalable solution that can be used in production environments.

## Prerequisites:
* Twilio Account: You need to have a Twilio account to get the Account SID and Auth Token, which are required to authenticate API requests.
* .NET 8 SDK: Install .NET 8 SDK for building and running the application.
* IDE: Visual Studio Code/ Visual Studio

* Set Up the Twilio Account
   - Go to the Twilio website, sign up, and create a new account if you haven't already.
   - Obtain the Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console.
   - Get a Twilio phone number capable of sending SMS messages.

* Create a New .NET 8 Web API Project
   - Open Visual Studio code or your preferred IDE.
   - Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project targeting .NET 8.
   - Install necessary packages:
      Twilio for integrating with Twilio API.
     ```
     dotnet add package Twilio
     ```
* Configure the Application
   In the appsettings.json file, store your Twilio credentials and settings securely:
   ```
   {
    "TwilioSettings": {
      "AccountSid": "your_twilio_account_sid",
      "AuthToken": "your_twilio_auth_token",
      "PhoneNumber": "your_twilio_phone_number"
    }
  }
  ```
* Testing the API
  Run the application and test it with an HTTP client like Postman or Swagger.

  POST /api/sms/send
  Request Body (JSON):

  ```
  {
    "to": "+1234567890",
    "message": "Hello from .NET 8 and Twilio API!"
  }
  ```
 If successful, you should receive a message and response as following

## Conclusion:
This project illustrates how to integrate Twilio's SMS service with .NET 8 Web API, providing a simple yet powerful solution to send SMS messages programmatically. 

You can further expand this project to include features like:

* Message history tracking.
* Sending SMS in bulk.
* Integrating other Twilio services like whatsapp messages, voice or email.
